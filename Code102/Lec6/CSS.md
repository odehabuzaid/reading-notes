#  CSS 

Css file (`Cascading Style Sheets`) is a sheet that creates the looking of a webpage or we can say how content is presented to users 
and in that sheet we define rules that specify styles applied to elements and present them to the user by the browser.

**adding CSS Style to web page** 

 three ways :

- inline css
- internal css
- external css 

**Example :**

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

The `rule` opens with a selector . 

This selects the HTML element that we are going to style.
In this case we are styling level one headings
