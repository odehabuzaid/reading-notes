# Learning Markdown



## MarkDown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004

```* Wikipedia
"Its key design goal is readability – that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions,unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions." 
```

## Usage

```
Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
```


## Examples

To use Markdown, you just apply simple tags to your text. For example, to format text in italics, you put underscores around it like so.
`_this is some text in italics_`

results : _this is some text in italics_

Here are some other examples of Markdown formatting:

Headers
`# This is an H1`
`## This is an H2`
`###### This is an H6`
# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
...


Bullet Points
`* Red`
`* Green`
`* Blue`
* Red 
* Green 
* Blue

Numbered Lists
`1. Bird`
`2. car`
`3. ship`

1. Bird 
2. car 
3. ship

Emphasis (Italics)
`*text*`
`_text_`

*text* 
_text_

Strong (Bold)
`**text**`
`__text__`

**text**

__text__

Markdown converts both *text* and _text_ to the HTML <emphasis> or <em> tag, which, in theory, can be interpreted in many ways. For example, you could build an app that interprets the <emphasis> tag as flashing red text. In practice, however, almost every application (including every web browser) interprets it as italicized text.


There are also variants of Markdown—such as CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)—but these are all based on the original Markdown specification. Variants usually just extend the standard by adding formatting tags the original Markdown doesn’t cover.
