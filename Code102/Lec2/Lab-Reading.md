# Design

**Web design** encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design).

**User experience design** is an extremely vast, multidisciplinary and fascinating field. It shapes the products and services we use on a daily basis, and can make or break the success of a business or brand.

* What is user experience (UX) design?

User experience design is a human-first way of designing products.
 
> “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”

Don Norman - Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy

Essentially, UX applies to anything that can be experienced—be it a website, a coffee machine, or a visit to the supermarket. The “user experience” part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service. User experience design, then, considers all the different elements that shape this experience.



* What is user interface (UI) design?
  
User interface design is a strictly digital term. A user interface is the point of interaction between the user and a digital device or product—like the touchscreen on your smartphone, or the touchpad you use to select what kind of coffee you want from the coffee machine. In relation to websites and apps, UI design considers the look, feel, and interactivity of the product. It’s all about making sure that the user interface of a product is as intuitive as possible, and that means carefully considering each and every visual, interactive element the user might encounter.

## The Diffrence Between UX - UI design 

> UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI design is all about how the product’s interfaces look and function.


## **WireFrame**

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

* **bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process**:

  1- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.

  2- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.

  3- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

* **Tolls & Software That can be used**:

  1- UXPin.com : UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive clickable prototypes directly in your browser.

  2- InVision.com : InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!

  3- Wireframe.cc : Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.

# HTML Structure
 What Is HTML

 HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

* **Example**
  
  `i need a cup of coffee` 

  If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
  
  ```html
  <p>i need a cup of coffee </p>
  ```
## **Anatomy of an HTML element**

Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.

>The main parts of our element are as follows:

- **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
- **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
- **The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
- **The element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.


## **Anatomy of an HTML document**
That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title On the Browser</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="<ImageFull-Dir" alt="Alternative Text for the pic">
  </body>
</html>
```

and thats all ,
