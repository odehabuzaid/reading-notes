# State and Props 

**What is a react state?**

> its an JavaScript object that stores a component's dynamic data and that what allows us to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

**What is a prop?**

> object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes, and that what allows us to pass data from one component to other component like any other function arguments

### the main difference :

`props` are variables passed by its parent component. `State` is variables that initialized and managed by the component. 
The `state` can be initialized by `props`.
