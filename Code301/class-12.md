1- fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL      | NoSQL |
| -----------  | ----------- |
|  static      | daynamic        |
|  vertical    | horizantal         |
| structured query language   | Un- structured query language         |
| require a downtime | no outage required         |
| can process complex queries   | No joins        |

2- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? 

`relational data` big data that require complex queries.

3- Give a real world example.

4- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? 

`hierarchical data `

5- Give a real world example.

6- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? `NoSQL database`

7- Which type of database is best for scalability? `SQL  database`

1- What does SQL stand for?

*Structured Query Language*

2- What is a realational database?

 *database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another they are based on the relational model, and represent data in tables*

3- What type of structure does a relational database work with?

> * in general data is structured as a set of tables and manipulated in accordance with the relational model of data. in each data base there is :
- a set of system catalog tables 
- a configuration file containing the parameter values
- a recovery log 

4- What is a ‘schema’?

* its a collection of database objects*
  
5- What is a NoSQL database?

*non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema*

6- Howo does it work?

*NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables in a key-value*

7- What is inside of a Mongo database?

*collections contain a sets of documents which consist data of key-value pairs*

8- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. `MongoDB`

9- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? 

1. Not Mature.
2. Less Support.
3. do not fit with legacy systems with old characteristics.
