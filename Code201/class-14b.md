### What Google Learned About Teams


* In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work
  together, in part; studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems


* unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is
  critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers

* After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project
  Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

* The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the
 ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated
  one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

* ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’
  Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

* The paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and
  number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
