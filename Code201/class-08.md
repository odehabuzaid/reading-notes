## **HTML css layout**


diffrent css layout frameworks help manage the layout of pages. They allow dividing HTML-elements into grids of rows and columns.

in css we can change the layout of the page using the position property in CSS, ex: normal flow, relative positioning and absolute positioning, also to indicate where the box should be positioned we can use box offset properties.

CSS grid is for layout, Flexbox is for alignment

We should use both of them together , but for different reasons. 
we use CSS grid and for alignment of your elements Flexbox

The flexbox layout makes it simpler to arrange elements in different screen sizes. It is therefore particularly useful in the context of responsive web design.


- `div` elements used as contaner elements in order to group other elements together.

```html
<div id="article">
<h1>This is a header<h1>
<p>this is an element<p>
```
- css frameworks provide rules for common tasks on a page , we can include multible css on a single page . 

- browsers display page element as FLOW if we do not specify a position 
    **fixed**
    **relative**
    **absolute**

- pages can be in a fixed layout or a stetchy ( depend on the content) width.


- grid layouts create a profissional and a flixable designs.
