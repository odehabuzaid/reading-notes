## *Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency*

> ### used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function.

Two factors evaluates the efficiency of a given algorithm:
    
    >  Running Time (Time Efficiency ): the time it takes to complete runing an the algorithm.
<br>
    
    >  Memory Space (Space Efficiency) : the amount of memory the algorthim takes to store data and instructions while running.


Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to <i><b>describe</b><i> the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job by looking at the factors (TIME/SPACE)

analyzing these factors is done by considering the following:

    Input Size
    Units of Measurement
    Orders of Growth
    Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case
 
 
## *Linked Lists*

> ### a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

Two types of Linked List:

    > singly : each node references the next node in the list.

    > doubly : each node references the next and previous node in the list.
