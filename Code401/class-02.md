## *In Tests We Trust*

- with Tests i will be able to check my code is outputting what am expected. 
- Writing (TDD) helps alot in problem solving process and can make it faster in some cases.
- Writing (TDD) helps break apart the problem in to smaller parts. =>
  > write a failing test  -> make it pass -> refactor -> repeat.
- in my opinion if am working solo , not in a team and i am doing the whole problem . writing tests in a typical way can be a total waste of time.

## *Recursion*
- its when i write a function that can call itself and rerun. 
- must make sure to have a base case in my recursive function to avoid going in an infinite recursion which will lead both me and my program to a stack overflow :) . 
- recursive function are a compact way to write things that could be written with iterative functions.

## *if __name__ == “__main__”:*

- the interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables.
- if that source file running as the main program module , it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. 
- If that source file being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. 
- Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

> A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
    
> The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.
