## <ins>*Linear Regressions*

linear regression is done using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.

    Scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

the sklearn.linear_model module which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”

*What is Linear Regression?*

Linear regression is a commonly used type of predictive analysis. 

The overall idea of regression is to examine if a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable? and Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, 

and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?
