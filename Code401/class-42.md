## Open-Source Software Contribution

Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. ... Although the main point of open source projects is to create valuable and accessible open source software, individual contributors can get plenty of personal benefit from contributing to them.

Today, many people get paid to work part- or full-time on open source. The most common way to get paid for your time is to talk to your employer. It's easier to make a case for open source work if your employer actually uses the project, but get creative with your pitch.

All Open Source software can be used for commercial purpose; the Open Source Definition guarantees this. You can even sell Open Source software. However, note that commercial is not the same as proprietary.

There is already a cohort of open-source software companies, some of which are public, that are surpassing $100M (or even $1B) in annual revenue: RedHat, Cloudera / Hortonworks (Hadoop), MuleSoft, Automattic (Wordpress), Elastic, MongoDB, Acquia (Drupal), Hashicorp, Confluent (Kafka), Databricks (Spark), and more.

## What motivates open source software contributors

Some of the study's results include:

1. **Intrinsic motivations play a key role.** The large majority of people contribute to FOSS because of fun (91%), altruism (85%), and kinship (80%). Moreover, when analyzing differences in motivations to join and continue, the study found that ideology, own-use, or education-related programs can be an impetus to join FOSS, but individuals continue for intrinsic reasons (fun, altruism, reputation, and kinship).

2. **Reputation and career motivate more than payment**. Many contributors seek reputation (68%) and career (67%), while payment was referenced by less than 30% of the participants. Compared to earlier studies, reputation is now considered more important.

3. **Social aspects have gained considerable importance since the 2000s.** Enjoying helping others (89%) and kinship (80%) rose in the rankings compared to surveys from the early 2000s.

4. **Motivation changes as people gain tenure.** A clear outcome of the paper is that current contributors often have a different motivation from what led them to join. Of the 281 respondents, 155 (55%) did not report the same motivation for joining and continuing to contribute.  

    The figure below shows individuals' shifts in motivation from when they joined to what leads them to keep contributing. The size of the boxes on the left represents the number of contributors with that motivation to start contributing to FOSS, and on the right, the motivation to continue contributing. The width of the connections is proportional to the number of contributors who shifted from one motivation to the other.

5. **Scratching one's own itch is a doorway.** Own-use ("scratch own itch") has decreased in importance since the early days. The contributors who joined FOSS for own-use-related reasons often shifted to altruism, learning, fun, and reciprocity. You can see this in the figure above.

6. **Experience and age explain different motivations**. Experienced developers have higher rates of reporting altruism (5.6x), pay (5.2x), and ideology (4.6x) than novices, who report career (10x), learning (5.5x), and fun (2.5x) as greater motivations to contribute. Looking at individual shifts in motivation, there was a considerable increase (120%) in altruism for experienced respondents and a slight decrease (-16%) for novices. A few young respondents joined FOSS because of career, but many of them shifted towards altruism (100% increase).

7. **Coders and non-coders report different motivations.** The odds of a coder reporting fun is 4x higher than non-coders, who are more likely (2.5x) to report ideology as a motivator.
