*What are They , Why & How to implement Stacks and Queues*

    Stacks are very useful for it's backtracking features. 
    
     Stacks can be used to implement recursive solutions iteratively. 
     
     Queues are useful when the ordering of the data matters.


Stacks and Queues are some of the latest data structures defined in computer science.

Stacks and Queues mostly implemented with an Array or Linked List.

**Stack**

they follow the Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

 > We need two  operations to implement a stack : 

push - adds an element to the top of the stack

pop - removes the element at the top of the stack

**Queue**

 they follow the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle

 > We need two operations to implement a stack :

enqueue - adds an element to the end of the queue

dequeue - removes the element at the beginning of the queue
